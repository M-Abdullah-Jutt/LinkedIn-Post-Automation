# LinkedIn-Post-Automation
I have created an AI Automation Workflow for generating LinkedIn posts using Make.com.
I just ran three lines of Python code to generate a trigger that includes all the required parameters.
Download the blueprint and import it into the make scenario environment, so you can use it.

I have attached a Python Notebook that contains three lines of code, including the webhook URL. You just need to write your topic in the prompt value and run the program. If you receive a '200' status code, it means the trigger is successfully generated.
